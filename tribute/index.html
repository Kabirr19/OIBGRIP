            <p>He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of 
                ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, 
                technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since 
                the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
            <p>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling 
                Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to 
                as the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and 
                public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, 
                including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.<br><br>
                While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed 
                and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including 
                national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, 
                where he was buried with full state honours.</p>

            <p>The Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam National Memorial was built in memory of Kalam by the DRDO in 
                Pei Karumbu, in the island town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. It was inaugurated by Prime 
                Minister Narendra Modi in July 2017. On display are the replicas of rockets and missiles 
                which Kalam had worked with. Acrylic paintings about his life are also displayed along with 
                hundreds of portraits depicting the life of the mass leader. There is a statue of Kalam in the 
                entrance showing him playing the Veena. There are two other smaller statues of the leader in 
                sitting and standing posture.</p><br>
